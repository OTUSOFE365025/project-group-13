# Step 1: Review Input Drivers

| Design purpose | The purpose is to create sequence diagrams to clarify the processes between layers using the architectural drivers. |
| Primary functional requirements | We are going to specifically look at one large scenario of UC-1, UC-6, and UC-7. |
| Quality attribute scenarios | |

| Scenario ID | Importance to the Customer | Difficulty of Implementation According to the Architect |
|-------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| QA-3 | High | Med |
| QA-5 | High | Med |

| Constraints | CON-2 would be addressed because setting a deadline reminder in the form of an announcement would be done only by authorized lecturers. |


# Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers

For this iteration, we need to select our use cases and define sequence diagrams for each. They are as follows:

- **UC-1:** External Systems Integration
- **UC-6:** Secure Login
- **UC-7:** Setting Deadline Reminders

# Step 3: Choose One or More Elements of the System to Refine

We will refine the specific relationships between the layers of the architectural design. This would result in a sequence diagram that outlines a lecturer signing securely signing in and setting deadline reminders that will integrate into external systems as an announcement in the LMS.
